The MOTD is customisable with Soulsetup (or directly sqlite3) :
Four variables can be used, and will be replaced with their values when the MOTD
is sent :
- %version%	: server version (like "0.3a")
- %nbusers%	: number of users already connected
- %username%	: name of the user who is connecting
- %userversion%	: version of the user's client

A simple MOTD could be :
Welcome, %username% !
This server is running Soulfind %version% and %nbusers% are already connected.
