To compile Soulfind under Windows(r)(c)(tm), first install
the DMD compiler by following the instructions at :
http://www.digitalmars.com/d/dcompiler.html

If you did not install DMD in C:\DMD, you will have to edit
the file Makefile.win and replace "\dmd\lib\ws2_32.lib"
with the actual path to your ws2_32.lib file.

Once DMD is installed and the correct environment variables
have been set, open a console window, cd to the Soulfind
directory and then type "make -f Makefile.win".

A "bin" directory should have been created, with soulfind.exe
and soulsetup.exe. Before running them, you should first copy
the file "win\sqlite.dll" either to c:\windows or to the bin
directory.

If you have a problem, you can always contact me at
seeschloss@seeschloss.org (another solution would be to use a
better operating system of course, since we all know Windows
is not meant to run servers).
