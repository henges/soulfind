.SH NAME
Soulfind \- Soulseek server software
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBsoulfind\fR
[\fB\fIdatabase-path\fB\fR]
[\fB--deamon\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBSoulfind\fR is a server program for the Soulseek filesharing network\&.
.PP
This server is mostly compatible with the official one, and can be used at least by the three Linux clients : Museek, Nicotine and PySLSK\&.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 
\fB\fIdatabase-path\fB\fR
Path to the \fBsqlite3\fR database, will be created if it doesn\&'t exist (default: \fI/var/db/soulfind/soulfind\&.db\fR)
.TP 
\fB-d\fR, \fB--daemon\fR
Immediately fork in the background, to run as a daemon\&.
.SH SOULFIND VS\&. OFFICIAL SOULSEEK SERVER
Soulfind has a few differences with the official, non-distributed, server\&. The most important of them is of course that Soulfind is GPL :)
.PP
\fBDistributed searches\fR are not implemented (yet)\&. First because they are probably a big piece of work, then because they will only be needed for really big networks, and finally because they are causing quite a few problems on the official network at the moment\&.
.PP
Almost all \fBunicode characters\fR are allowed for usernames and chatrooms, except for known non-printing characters, or characters that look the same (e\&.g\&.: non-breaking space, thin space, zero-width joiner)\&.
