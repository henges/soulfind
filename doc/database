Soulfind's database has three tables :
* users  (username text, password text, speed integer, ulnum integer, files integer, folders integer, banned integer, privileges integer)
	- the banned field isn't used yet
	- privileges are stored in seconds

* admins (username text, level integer)
	- level isn't used yet, it is intended to create a hierarchy between admins

* conf (port integer, max_users integer, max_message_size integer)
	- port             : port to listen on
	- max_users        : max number of connections to accept (does not actually limit the number of connected users, but reserves this number of sockets)
